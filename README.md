# Best Practices and suggestions
* Do NOT use the "Root Account" for anything other than creating new IAM accounts, or managing IdentityCenter assets.
* Use MFA.  Always. (where possible)
* Create and use a ["tagging strategy"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) of some sort.
* (NEW) Identity Center is tremendous and quite powerful.  I recommend using it.
