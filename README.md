# Best Practices and suggestions
* Do NOT use the "Root Account" for anything other than creating new IAM accounts.
* Use MFA.  Always. (where possible)
* Cloud9 is a great IDE which is integrated to AWS Services and does not require management of AWS access keys.
* Create and use a ["tagging strategy"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) of some sort.
